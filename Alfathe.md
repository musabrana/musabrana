My tenure was marked by growth, acquiring expertise in various aspects. in 2014, I seized the opportunity to venture into entrepreneurship.

SUCCESS STORY

In December 2022, Mr. Javaid Nundani, a dedicated farmer in Tando Allahyar, faced financial challenges, struggling to bear the burden of his lease amount while managing a 600-acre of land out of 410 Rhodes grass. Seeking a transformation in his farming venture, he reached out to Al Fathe International.
Upon our initial meeting on December, 2022, I assessed Mr. Nundani’s situation and committed to enhancing his farming operations. Recognizing the need for a comprehensive plan, we worked closely together to redefine his approach to farming.
By January 2023, a finalized execution plan was in place. We strategically optimized his land holdings, reducing it to 288 acres of Rhodes grass, ensuring a more sustainable and profitable farming operation. The focus was not only on maximizing acreage but also on improving the quality and yield of the crops.
The 2023 farming season witnessed a remarkable transformation. Despite challenges, Mr. Javaid Nundani’s annual production figures surged to an impressive 32.85% Higher than the perivious year’s hay production. it's a testament to the financial sustainability we achieved.
